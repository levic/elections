      <p>Celebrity candidate is ex-Liberal ivermectin spokesperson/anti-vaxxer Craig "renewable energy will kill people" Kelly who thinks that climate change doesn't exist.
        He also doesn't realise that if you're going to use a 100 year old photo as evidence that sea levels aren't rising you might want to check first whether one comparison

      <p>Two Facebook heroes from the fight against the now-finished covid lockdowns still running on an anti-lockdown
        platform.</p>
      <p>Most famous is failed reality TV hopeful Monica Smit who publicly violated covid rules and then live streamed
        her arrest as part of her "independent news" show. She deliberately refused bail and then appealed to
        anti-lockdowners' sense of injustice. The true belivers dug deep and gave her $300k in donations to offset her
        (pro bono) "legal fees".</p>
      <p>Apart from thinking their feelings create medical reality, they're also not too good with facts
        (eg "Australians are among the most heavily taxed in the world" -- actually we're in the lowest 25% of
        industrialised countries)</p>

      <label>Summary:</label>
      <p>The party for those who long to return to 1890s government.
        Anything the government does other than defence and the justice system is tyranny.
        (Particularly
        <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-03/sarah-hanson-young-david-leyonhjelm-defamation-appeal/13210042">defamation cases</a>
        brought by Greens senators!)</p>
      <p>Really should be called Libertarians but that name was taken, so they chose something close enough to one of the major parties that uninformed people would be confused but different enough to survive Howard's attempt to force
        them
        to change their name in 2006.</p>
      <p>Libertarianism often turns into a faith-based ideology and if science ever conflicts with their beliefs then the science must be wrong; thus covid is "no worse than the flu" and climate change isn't real.</p>
      <p>Despite their radical policies, have demonstrated a propensity to negotiate compromises when actually elected and have both labor and liberal preferences</p>

    </div>
    <div class="highlights">
      <label>Policy Highlights:</label>
      <ul>
        <li>No more schools, childcare, ABC, SBS or paid parental leave</li>
        <li>Completely silent on healthcare, although their previous senator advocated for private healthcare
          savings funds instead of government funded healthcare
        </li>
        <li>HECS is ok, but it should cover the full cost of universities (no more govt subsidies)</li>
        <li>No cash bans (Don't they know that privately issued money was common in the 19th century? Why are they accepting government issued currency at all?)</li>
        <li>Nuclear powerplants</li>
        <li>No more minimum wage</li>
        <li>No more licensing or certifications</li>
        <li>No more trading hour restrictions (this is somehow good for mom & dad retailers)</li>
        <li>Allow small businesses to ignore eg food safety regulations as long as they put a sign up in your store</li>
        <li>More guns</li>
        <li>Employers should be able to fire employees without needing a reason</li>
        <li>No more regulations on insurers or banks, also no more bank deposit guarantees</li>
        <li>No govt funding for election campaigns</li>
        <li>No government vaccine mandates. Employer mandates are ok</li>
        <li>No more lockdowns</li>
        <li>Govt out of private affairs: same-sex marriage, repeal drug laws, allow assisted suicide</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer Curve</a> peak is at 20%, so we need a flat 20% tax.
          In their fantasy land this will be revenue neutral (<em>because almost every economist in the world is wrong:
          the LDP's modelling says it will work, and Reagan/Stockman's failed experiment in the 80s doesn't count because reasons</em>).
          While almost all of the savings would flow to the rich, this is a <em>good</em> thing.
